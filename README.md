# RNN for biomass gasification
This repository is set up for testing the RNN model developed for temporal evolution of important reactants and products during biomass gasification in the freeboard region of a fluidized bed reactor.

The repository contains the model (`model.h5`), sample test data (`sample-test-data.npz`), scalers for scaling the data (`xsacler` and `yscaler`), and a test script for running the model on the test data and plotting the temporal evolution of products as predicted by the model.

The model is published in: Krishna Sharma, Niket Kaisare, and Himanshu Goyal, A recurrent neural network model for biomass gasification chemistry, Reaction Chemistry & Engineering.
